## CSS definition for a Component

### Template Declaration

```html
<template>
    <a href={url}>{name}</a>
    <p>{tagline}</p>
</template>
```

### CSS Declaration

```css
a { color: red; }
p { margin: 10px 0; }
```

The CSS will be compiled, and a prefix will be added on every rule to guarantee that especifity of the rule only applies to the body of the host element (the custom element that represents the component).

The rule of

### Styling the host element

The `:host` allows you to style the element hosting the component:

```css
:host {
  opacity: 0.4;
  transition: opacity 420ms ease-in-out;
}
:host(:hover) {
  opacity: 1;
}
:host(:active) {
  position: relative;
  top: 3px;
  left: 3px;
}
```

The CSS will be compiled, and a prefix will replace `:host` to guarantee that especifity of the rule only applies to the host element (the custom element that represents the component).

One gotcha is that rules in the parent page have higher specificity than `:host` rules defined in CSS file, but lower specificity than a `style` attribute defined on the host element.

## Important Notice

Implementations should not rely, or use the selectors generated by the Raptor compiler. This is an implementation detail of Raptor and relying on it in user-land can potentially break your code in future releases.
